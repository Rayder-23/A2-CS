# Info regarding the fix applied:

# In Python, reading a global variable inside a function is allowed without declaring it as global.
# But modifying (assigning to) it requires a global declaration.

# In contrast, when you do this:
# top_of_stack = top_of_stack + 1

# Python sees top_of_stack on the left side of =, and so assumes it's a new local variable.
# But you're also trying to read it first (top_of_stack + 1), and at that point, the 
# local version hasn't been assigned yet â€” hence the UnboundLocalError.
