# A2-CS
This repository (a central location in which data is stored and managed.) contains code with comments and explanations of most of the Cambridge International Examination (CIE) GCSE A2 Computer Science Paper 4 (coding-based-paper) topics as of 2025 as I gave this paper in 2025.

It also includes PDF Files from Sir Zain Merchant of both P3 and P4 of the same year aswell as my own notes for P3 that I made in collaboration with a friend. In addition, the 'Extra' folder contains some helpful functions and tips that I gathered from ChatGPT with strict instructions to keep it's responses in the limits of CIE AL CS guidelines.

I am open to changes or updates to this repository if someone else is willing to do the work. I highly doubt I myself will be updating it anytime soon. Feel free to contact me on Discord @ 'RayderRaidz'
